compilation: testing.c 
	gcc testing.c -o letsgo 
#i can make this whole thing work with lestgo, its the word I picked, thanks to -o (output)
#testing.c next to compilation is neccesary because otherwise it gets errors
#cc: error: testing.c: No such file or directory
#gcc: fatal error: no input files
